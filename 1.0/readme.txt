== Description ==

When i decided to launch my blog, i made a little Wordpress's plug-in (i didn't find it) called "Sanitize with underscores": as you can imagine it allows to use undescores '_' in the permalink rather then default hyphen '-'.

Before:
`http://[...]/name - of - post.html`

After:
`http://[...]/name _ of _ post.html`
